## 1. Setting Up Your Development Environment

### 1.1 Start GitHub Codespaces

**GitHub Codespaces** provides a cloud-based development environment directly in your browser or Visual Studio Code. It allows you to develop, build, and debug your applications without setting up a local environment.

- **Launching Codespaces:**

  - Navigate to your GitHub repository.
  - Click on the **Code** button.
  - Select the **Codespaces** tab.
  - Click on **Create codespace on main** (or the branch you're working on).

If Codespaces is not already started, refer to [day1.md](day1.md) for detailed steps on how to launch it.

### 1.2 Navigate to API1 Directory

Once Codespaces is running, open the terminal within Codespaces.

- Change to the `API1` project directory:

  ```bash
  cd C_Sharp/dotnet8/API1
  ```

### 1.3 Install Azure Tools Extensions

Ensure that the **Azure Tools** extensions are installed in your Codespaces environment. These extensions enable you to interact with Azure services directly from Visual Studio Code.

- **Installing Azure Tools Extensions:**

  - Open the **Extensions** panel in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+X).
  - Search for **Azure Tools**.
  - Install the **Azure Tools** extension pack. This will install the following six Azure extensions:

    - Azure Account
    - Azure App Service
    - Azure Functions
    - Azure Storage
    - Azure Resources
    - Azure Databases

### 1.4 Install Azure Functions Core Tools

The **Azure Functions Core Tools** allow you to run and debug Azure Functions locally.

- **Installing via Command Palette:**

  - Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** to open the command palette.
  - Type **Azure Functions: Install or Update Azure Functions Core Tools** and select it.
  - Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

- **Alternatively, install using npm:**

  ```bash
  npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools@4 --unsafe-perm true
  ```

**References:**

- [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)

---

## 2. Running and Testing the Azure Function Locally (API1)

### 2.1 Run the Function Locally

Now that your environment is set up, let's run the Azure Function locally.

- **Start the Function App:**

  - Ensure you're in the `C_Sharp/dotnet8/API1` directory.
  - Run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    func start
    ```

  This command builds and runs your Azure Function locally.

### 2.2 Test the Function

- **Access the Function in the Browser:**

  - After running the function, you should see output indicating the URL where your function is hosted, typically something like:

    ```
    Functions:

            HttpExample: [GET,POST] http://localhost:7071/api/HttpExample
    ```

  - GitHub Codespaces automatically forwards ports, so you can access your function from your local browser.


- **If Port Forwarding Doesn't Work:**

  - Manually forward the port:

    - In Codespaces, click on **Ports**.
    - Click on **Forward a Port**.
    - Enter **7071** and click **OK**.
    - Access the function using the forwarded URL.

- **Test the Function:**

  - Navigate to the URL provided (e.g., `https://your-codespace-name-7071.githubpreview.dev/api/HttpExample`).
  - You should see the expected response from your Azure Function.

## 3. Deploying API1 to Azure Using GitHub Actions

### 3.1 Create an Azure Function App in Azure

Before deploying, you need to create an Azure Function App in your Azure subscription.
_NOTE: Use the same resource group as day1 to simplify cleanup_ 
_NOTE: The free tier for Azure Functions is Y1

- **Options to Create an Azure Function App:**

  - **Using VS Code Extension:**

    - Open the **Azure** panel in VS Code.
    - Click on **Create New Project** under **Azure Functions**.
    - Follow the prompts to select region, language, and other settings. 
    - When prompted, choose to **Create a new Function App in Azure**.

  - **Using Azure CLI:**

    - Open the terminal.
    - Create a Resource Group (if not already created):

      ```bash
      az group create --name <ResourceGroupName> --location <Location>
      ```

    - Create a Storage Account:

      ```bash
      az storage account create --name <StorageAccountName> --location <Location> --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --sku Standard_LRS
      ```

    - Create an App Service Plan:

      ```bash
      az appservice plan create --name <AppServicePlanName> --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --sku F1 --is-linux
      ```

    - Create the Function App:

      ```bash
      az functionapp create --resource-group <ResourceGroupName> --consumption-plan-location <Location> --runtime dotnet-isolated --functions-version 4 --name <FunctionAppName> --storage-account <StorageAccountName>
      ```

  - **Using Azure Portal:**

    - Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
    - Click **Create a resource** and search for **Function App**.
    - Click **Create** and follow the prompts to configure your Function App.

**References:**

- [Create your first function using the Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-cli-csharp)
- [Create your first function using Visual Studio Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/create-first-function-vs-code-csharp)

### 3.2 Deploy Manually Using the Extension

Before automating the deployment, let's manually deploy the function to ensure everything works.

- **Deploy Using VS Code Extension:**

  - In the **Azure** panel, right-click on your Function App and select **Deploy to Function App**.
  - Choose the Function App you created in Azure.
  - VS Code will package and deploy your function.

- **Note:** Since the source code has an anonymous function, no credentials are needed for testing.

### 3.3 Create a GitHub Action for Deployment

Now, let's automate the deployment process using GitHub Actions.

- **Create a New GitHub Action:**

  - In your GitHub repository, navigate to the **Actions** tab.
  - Click on **New workflow**.
  - Search for **Azure Functions** and **DOT NET**.
  - Select the **Deploy Azure Functions** workflow template.

- **Configure the Workflow:**

  - **Set the Working Directory:**

    Ensure the workflow operates in the correct directory.

    ```yaml
    defaults:
      run:
        working-directory: C_Sharp/dotnet8/API1
    ```

  - **Trigger the Workflow Only on Changes to `API1`:**

    ```yaml
    on:
      push:
        paths:
          - 'C_Sharp/dotnet8/API1/**'
    ```

- **Create a Service Principal for Deployment**

  Since Azure Functions doesn't use a publish profile, we'll create a **Service Principal** for authentication.

  - **Create Service Principal Using Azure CLI:**

    ```bash
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "<ServicePrincipalName>" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/<SubscriptionID>/resourceGroups/<ResourceGroupName> --sdk-auth
    ```

    - Replace `<ServicePrincipalName>`, `<SubscriptionID>`, and `<ResourceGroupName>` with your values.
    - This command outputs a JSON object containing:

      - `clientId`
      - `clientSecret`
      - `subscriptionId`
      - `tenantId`

  - **Add Credentials to GitHub Secrets:**

    - In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
    - Click **New repository secret**.
    - **Name:** `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`
    - **Value:** Paste the JSON output from the previous step.
    - Click **Add secret**.

  **Where to get the values:**

  - **Tenant ID:** Found in the Azure Portal under **Azure Active Directory** > **Properties**.
  - **Subscription ID:** Found in the Azure Portal under **Subscriptions**.
  - **Resource Group Name:** The name of the resource group you created in Day 1.

- **Update the Workflow with Azure Login:**

  Add the Azure Login action using the service principal credentials.

  ```yaml
  - name: 'Login via Azure CLI'
    uses: azure/login@v1
    with:
      creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
  ```

- **Deploy the Function:**

  Complete the workflow with steps to build and deploy the function.

  ```yaml
  - name: 'Set up .NET Core SDK'
    uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v3
    with:
      dotnet-version: '8.0.x'

  - name: 'Restore dependencies'
    run: dotnet restore

  - name: 'Build'
    run: dotnet build --configuration Release --no-restore

  - name: 'Publish'
    run: dotnet publish --configuration Release --output ./publish_output --no-build --no-restore

  - name: 'Deploy to Azure Functions'
    uses: Azure/functions-action@v1
    with:
      app-name: <FunctionAppName>
      package: ./publish_output
  ```

  - Replace `<FunctionAppName>` with the name of your Azure Function App.

- **Commit and Push the Workflow:**

  - Save the workflow file in `.github/workflows/`.
  - Commit and push the changes to trigger the workflow.

## 7. FAQ

*Azure Functions and Serverless Architecture*
### What are Azure Functions, and how do they fit into the serverless computing model?
Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that enables you to run code on-demand without explicitly provisioning or managing infrastructure. They fit into the serverless computing model by abstracting server management, automatically scaling based on workload, and charging only for the compute resources used during execution. This allows developers to focus solely on writing code to respond to events or triggers, promoting rapid development and deployment.

### What are the differences from traditional APIs, benefits over hosting on virtual machines or web apps.
Traditional APIs hosted on virtual machines or web apps require manual infrastructure management, including server provisioning, scaling, and maintenance. Azure Functions eliminate this overhead by automatically handling infrastructure concerns. Benefits include reduced operational costs due to pay-per-use pricing, automatic scaling to handle varying workloads, faster time-to-market, and the ability to build modular, event-driven applications.

### What are the differences between the Consumption Plan and Premium Plan in Azure Functions?
The Consumption Plan charges based on per-second resource consumption and scales automatically but may experience cold starts. The Premium Plan provides pre-warmed instances to avoid cold starts, supports virtual network connectivity, and offers more powerful computing options, but charges are based on allocated instances regardless of usage. The Premium Plan is ideal for applications requiring consistent performance and advanced networking features.

### How can I schedule Azure Functions to run at specific times?
You can schedule Azure Functions using the Timer Trigger, which allows you to define schedules using CRON expressions. By specifying the schedule in the function's configuration, the function will execute automatically at the designated times. This is useful for running periodic tasks like data cleanup, report generation, or maintenance activities.

### What is the lifecycle of an Azure Function or an Azure Container App instance?
An Azure Function instance is instantiated in response to an event or trigger, runs your code, and then goes idle, with automatic scaling handling multiple instances based on demand. In the Consumption Plan, instances may be recycled after periods of inactivity (cold starts). An Azure Container App instance runs as a container within a managed Kubernetes environment, maintaining the container lifecycle, which includes pulling the image, starting the container, running until stopped, and scaling in response to traffic using Kubernetes-based event-driven autoscaling (KEDA).

*Development Environment and Tools*
### How do I set up and use Codespaces effectively, including handling port forwarding issues?
To set up Codespaces, ensure your repository is configured for Codespaces and create a new codespace from GitHub. Use the integrated terminal and editor for development, and test your application within the environment. For port forwarding, Codespaces automatically forwards ports, but if issues arise, manually forward ports using the Ports tab by adding the desired port and setting it to public visibility.

### What is the purpose of the Azure Tools Extensions, and how do they enhance development?
The Azure Tools Extensions in Visual Studio Code provide integrated support for managing Azure resources directly from the editor. They enhance development by enabling tasks like creating and deploying Azure Functions, managing resource groups, and accessing Azure Storage, all within VS Code. This streamlines the development workflow by reducing context switching between tools.

### Why do we need Azure Functions Core Tools, and how are they used?
Azure Functions Core Tools allow you to develop, run, and debug Azure Functions locally before deploying to Azure. They provide a local runtime environment that emulates the Azure Functions runtime, enabling testing of functions with triggers and bindings. This helps ensure that your functions work as expected in a local setting before moving to the cloud.

### How do I test my Azure Functions and Container Apps locally before deploying?
For Azure Functions, use the Azure Functions Core Tools to run functions locally with func start, and test them using tools like Postman or a web browser. For Container Apps, use Docker to build and run your container locally with docker build and docker run, allowing you to verify functionality and debug issues in your development environment.

### How do I handle dependencies and package management in my Azure Functions projects?
In Azure Functions projects using .NET, manage dependencies with NuGet packages by adding them to your project file (.csproj). Ensure all required packages are included and restore them using dotnet restore. For other languages, use the language-specific package managers like npm for JavaScript or pip for Python to manage dependencies, and include them in your project's configuration files.

*Deployment Strategies and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)*
### What are the different methods to create and deploy an Azure Function App, and when should each be used?
You can create and deploy an Azure Function App using the Azure Portal for a graphical interface, Azure CLI for scripting and automation, or Visual Studio Code with Azure Extensions for an integrated development experience. Choose the Azure Portal for quick setups, Azure CLI for automation and integration with scripts, and VS Code for seamless development and deployment directly from your editor.

### How do I manually deploy Azure Functions using the Azure Extension in VS Code?
In VS Code, after installing the Azure Functions extension, sign in to your Azure account. Right-click your function project in the Explorer pane and select Deploy to Function App. Follow the prompts to select or create a Function App in Azure, and the extension will package and deploy your code directly to Azure.

### How do I implement CI/CD pipelines beyond GitHub Actions?
You can implement CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps Pipelines, Jenkins, or other CI/CD platforms. These tools allow you to define build and release workflows that automate the process of testing, building, and deploying your applications to Azure. Integrate them with your source control system and configure triggers based on events like code commits or pull requests.

### How can I configure my GitHub Actions workflow to trigger only on changes to specific paths, and how can I test this configuration?
In your GitHub Actions workflow file, use the paths key under the push or pull_request event to specify the directories or files to monitor. For example:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'src/functions/**'
To test the configuration, make changes to files within the specified paths and push them to your repository, verifying that the workflow is triggered accordingly.
```

### How do I handle versioning and updates for my deployed Functions and Containers to automate deployments while minimizing downtime?
Use deployment slots in Azure Functions to deploy updates to a staging slot before swapping to production, ensuring smooth transitions. For containers, implement rolling updates or blue-green deployments using revision management in Azure Container Apps. Tag your images with version numbers, and automate deployments through CI/CD pipelines to promote consistent and reliable updates.

*Containerization and Azure Container Apps*
### What are Azure Container Apps, and how do they compare to Azure Functions, including in terms of scaling?
Azure Container Apps is a serverless container service enabling you to run microservices and containerized applications without managing complex infrastructure like Kubernetes. Compared to Azure Functions, which is ideal for event-driven, stateless functions, Container Apps provide more control over the entire application environment. Both support automatic scaling, but Container Apps can scale based on custom metrics and provide more flexibility in resource configurations.

### How do I generate a Dockerfile for my Azure Function, and what should it contain?
You can generate a Dockerfile using the Azure Functions Core Tools with the command func init . --docker-only. The Dockerfile should contain the base image for the Azure Functions runtime, copy your function code, restore dependencies, and set the entry point for the function host. It ensures your function runs within a containerized environment replicating the Azure Functions runtime.

### What is the process to create and manage an Azure Container Registry (ACR), including setting up permissions and secure access for my Container Apps to pull images?
Create an ACR using the Azure Portal or Azure CLI with az acr create. Set up permissions by enabling the admin user or using Azure Active Directory service principals with appropriate roles. To secure access, use managed identities or provide the necessary credentials in your deployment configuration, ensuring your Container Apps can authenticate with ACR to pull images securely.

### How do I build and push a Docker image to ACR, and deploy it to an Azure Container App?
Build your Docker image using docker build and tag it with your ACR login server URL. Log in to ACR with az acr login, then push the image using docker push. Deploy to an Azure Container App by creating the app with the image reference, specifying the registry credentials if necessary, either through the CLI with az containerapp create or via the Azure Portal.

### Why do we need to update ACR settings to allow login, and how is this done securely?
By default, ACR requires authentication to ensure only authorized users can push or pull images. Update ACR settings to enable access for your deployment by configuring service principals, managed identities, or enabling the admin user account. Secure methods involve using managed identities or service principals with least-privilege roles, avoiding hardcoding credentials, and storing secrets securely in platforms like Azure Key Vault.

### How do I set up GitHub Actions to build and deploy containers?
In your GitHub repository, create a workflow YAML file that defines steps to check out the code, log in to ACR using Azure credentials, build the Docker image, push it to ACR, and then deploy to Azure Container Apps using the Azure CLI action. Use GitHub Secrets to store sensitive information like Azure credentials and reference them securely in your workflow.

*Security, Secret Management, and Best Practices*
### What is a Service Principal, and why is it necessary for GitHub Actions?
A Service Principal is a security identity used by applications or services to access specific Azure resources. In GitHub Actions, it's necessary to authenticate with Azure non-interactively, allowing the workflow to perform actions like deployments securely. It provides controlled access with defined permissions, ensuring that automated processes follow the principle of least privilege.

### How do I securely store and reference secrets and credentials in GitHub Actions?
Store secrets in GitHub by navigating to your repository's settings and adding them under Secrets and variables > Actions. Reference them in your workflow using the syntax ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }}. This ensures that sensitive information like passwords and keys are not exposed in your codebase or logs.

### How do I secure my Azure Functions and Container Apps, including accessing other Azure resources securely?
Use application settings and managed identities to avoid hardcoding credentials. Managed identities allow your functions and apps to authenticate to Azure services without storing credentials. Implement network security measures like VNet integration and use Azure Key Vault to manage secrets. Apply role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict permissions to the minimum required.

### What are the best practices for diagnosing deployment problems and debugging runtime errors in Azure Functions and Container Apps?
Enable and review application logs using Azure Monitor and Application Insights. Use the built-in logging mechanisms to capture detailed error information. For deployment issues, check deployment logs and utilize tools like the Azure Portal's Diagnose and solve problems feature. Implement structured logging and monitor performance metrics to identify and resolve issues proactively.

### How do I implement error handling and retries in my Functions?
In your function code, implement try-catch blocks to handle exceptions gracefully. Use durable functions or configure retry policies in the function's host.jsonfile to automate retries for transient errors. Logging errors and integrating with monitoring tools allows for alerting and further investigation when exceptions occur.

### Are there any limitations or quotas I should be aware of when using Azure Functions or Container Apps?
Yes, Azure Functions have quotas on execution time, memory usage, and concurrent executions, which vary based on the hosting plan (Consumption or Premium). Azure Container Apps have limitations on resource allocations per container and per environment. You can review the official Azure documentation on service limits and plan accordingly to avoid unexpected constraints.

*Management, Scaling, Monitoring, and Additional Considerations*
### How do I scale my Azure Functions and Container Apps effectively?
Azure Functions scale automatically based on trigger types and incoming load. For finer control, use the Premium Plan or App Service Plan. Azure Container Apps scale using Kubernetes-based event-driven autoscaling (KEDA), allowing you to define scaling rules based on metrics like CPU usage or custom events. Configure scaling parameters to match your application's performance and cost requirements.

### What are the cost implications of using Azure Functions versus Azure Container Apps?
Azure Functions in the Consumption Plan charge based on execution time and resource consumption, making it cost-effective for intermittent workloads. The Premium Plan incurs fixed costs but offers more features. Azure Container Apps charge for the resources allocated (compute and memory) and the duration they run. Review pricing models for each service to estimate costs based on your usage patterns.

### What monitoring and logging options are available once my applications are deployed?
Azure provides Application Insights for detailed monitoring of both Functions and Container Apps, offering metrics, logs, and telemetry data. Use Azure Monitor to track resource utilization, performance, and set up alerts. Log Analytics allows for centralized log management and querying capabilities across your Azure resources.

### How do I manage environment configurations for different stages (Development, Staging, Production), and what are the best practices for code organization in large Function Apps?
Use deployment slots in Azure Functions to separate environments and enable smooth swaps between stages. Manage configurations using application settings specific to each slot. For code organization, structure your Function Apps by feature or service, and consider using separate Function Apps for unrelated functions to improve maintainability and scalability.

### Can I use custom domains and SSL with my Azure Functions and Container Apps?
Yes, you can map custom domains to your Azure Functions and Container Apps. For Functions on the Premium or App Service Plan, configure custom domains via the Azure Portal and upload SSL certificates. For Container Apps, configure custom domains and certificates in the Azure Portal under your Container App's settings, enabling secure and branded endpoints.

### How do I handle data persistence and storage in my applications?
Use Azure services like Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB, or Azure Storage (Blobs, Queues, Tables) for data persistence. Access these services securely from your Functions or Container Apps using managed identities or secure connection strings stored in application settings. Choose the storage solution that best fits your data requirements in terms of structure, scalability, and access patterns.

### How do I migrate existing applications to Azure Functions or Container Apps?
Assess your application's architecture to identify components suitable for serverless or containerized deployment. Refactor code where necessary to comply with the stateless and event-driven nature of Azure Functions or to containerize applications for Azure Container Apps. Use tools like the Azure Migrate service or follow migration guides provided by Azure to facilitate the transition.

### What learning resources are recommended to deepen understanding of Azure services?
Leverage official Microsoft documentation on Azure Functions and Azure Container Apps. Utilize Microsoft Learn for interactive tutorials and modules. Engage with the developer community through forums like Stack Overflow, Microsoft Q&A, and attend webinars or join Azure-focused user groups. Hands-on practice through projects and experimentation is also highly beneficial.
